        This is just a bunch of words.  Don't worry about reading this.  It might not be that interesting.  After all, I was told I could put anything here that I wanted.  By the way, did you know that the secret to life, universe, and everything is 42?  What then is the question?  Some have hypothisized that the question is "What is six times seven?"  I know, a simple question for its answer to equal the answer to life, universe, and everything. To me it makes sense that it doesn't make sense though.  After all, the question that got the answer 42 in the first place wasn't even a proper question.  No wonder they got gibberish.
